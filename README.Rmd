<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of gmatlib is to provide a set of functions
for common numerical analysis algorithms.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gmatlib from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("borocopy/gmatlib")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(gmatlib)
fn <- function(x) 12 * x - 9
xs <- seq(1, 10, 0.5)
linfit(xs, fn(xs))

integrate_simpson(sin, 0, 3.14159, 2000)
```
